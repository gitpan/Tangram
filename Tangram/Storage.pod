=head1 NAME

Tangram::Storage - persistent object database

L<Tangram::Schema>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Tangram;
   
   $storage = Tangram::Storage->connect( $schema,
      $data_source, $username, $password );

   $oid = $storage->insert( $obj );
   @oids = $storage->insert( @objs );

   $storage->update( $obj );
   $storage->update( @objs );

   $obj = $storage->load( $oid );
   @objs = $storage->load( @oids );

   @objs = $storage->select( $class );
   @objs = $storage->select( $remote, $filter );

   $cursor = $storage->cursor( $remote, $filter );

   $storage->disconnect();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An Tangram::Storage object is a connection to a database configured for use with Tangram.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 connect( $schema, $data_source, $username, $auth, \%options )

Connects to a storage and return a handle object. Dies in case of failure.

$schema is an L<Tangram::Schema> object consistent with the database.

$data_source, $username and $auth are passed directly to
DBI::connect().

\%options is a reference to a hash that may contain the following
fields:

=over 4

=item * dbh 

=item * dialect

=back

All fields are optional.

C<dbh> can be used to connect a Storage via an existing DBI
handle. $data_source, $username and $auth are still needed because
Tangram may need to open extra connections (see below).

C<dialect> contains a Dialect object (see L<Tangram::Dialect>); this is
useful for accessing extra functionality available in some dialects of
SQL. You may also specify the dialect as a class name.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 SCALAR AND LIST CONTEXTS

Most instance methods in Storage can be called in both scalar and list contexts.
In scalar context, a single argument is allowed, and a single scalar value is returned.
In list context, any number of arguments is allowed; the results are returned as a
list of the same size as the argument list.

When both context types are allowed, the following code:

   @results = $storage->method( @args )

...is equivalent to:

   @results = map { $storage->method( $_ ) } @args

=head2 insert( @objs )

Inserts objects in storage. Returns the ID(s) assigned to the object(s).
This method is valid in both L<scalar and list contexts>.

The inserted objects must be of a class described in the schema associated to the storage.

Attempting to insert an object that is already persistent in the storage is an error.

Tangram will automatically insert any object that is refered by $obj if it is not
already present in storage. In the following example:

   my $homer = NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Homer', name => 'Simpson',
      children => Set::Object->new(
         NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Bart', name => 'Simpson' ),
         NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Lisa', name => 'Simpson' ),
         NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Maggie', name => 'Simpson' ) ) );

   $storage->insert( $homer );

...Tangram automatically inserts the kids along with Homer.

=head2 update( @objs )

Save objects to storage.
This method is valid in both L<scalar and list contexts>.

The objects must be of a class described in the schema associated to the storage.

Attempting to update an object that is not already present in the storage is an error.

Tangram will automatically insert any object that is refered by an inserted object if it is not
already present in storage. It will not automatically update the refered objects that are already
stored. In the following example:

   my $homer = NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Homer', name => 'Simpson' );
   $storage->insert( $homer );

   my $marge = NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Marge', name => 'Simpson', age => 34 );
   $storage->insert( $marge );

   $marge->{age} = 35;

   $homer->{partner} = $marge;

   $homer->{children} = Set::Object->new(
      NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Bart', name => 'Simpson' ),
      NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Lisa', name => 'Simpson' ),
      NaturalPerson->new( firstName => 'Maggie', name => 'Simpson' ) );

   $storage->update( $homer );

...Tangram automatically inserts the kids when their father is updated. OTOH, $marge will not be
automatically inserted nor updated; her age will remain '34' in persistent storage.

=head2 id( @ids )

Returns the IDs of the given objects. If an object is not persistent in storage yet, its
corresponding ID is undef().

This method is valid in both L<scalar and list contexts>.

=head2 load( @ids )

Returns a list of objects given their IDs.
Dies if any ID has no corresponding persistent object in storage.

This method is valid in both L<scalar and list contexts>.

=head2 remote( @classes )

Returns a list of L<Tangram::Remote> objects of given classes.
This method is valid in both L<scalar and list contexts>.

=head2 select( $remote [ , $filter ] )

Returns a list containing all the objects that are type-compatible with $remote, and
satisfy $filter if it is present (see also: Remote and Filter).

Valid only in list context.

=head2 select( $remote, opt1 => val1 [, op2 => val2 ... ] )

Returns a list containing all the objects that are type-compatible
with $remote.

A series of optional directives can be passed as key/value
pairs. Currently Tangram recognizes the following directives:

=over 4

=item * filter

=item * order

=item * desc

=back

Option C<filter> specifies a Filter that can be used to restrict the
result set.

Option C<order> is an array of Expr; order result set by increasing
value of Exprs.

Option C<desc> is a boolean; a true value reverses the order specified
by the C<order> option.

Valid only in list context.

=head2 cursor( $remote [ , $filter ] )

Returns a Cursor on the objects that are type-compatible with $remote, and
satisfy $filter if it is present (see also: Remote and Filter).

$remote must be an Tangram::Remote object. $filter must be an Tangram::Filter if it is present.

Valid only in scalar context.

=head2 cursor( $remote, opt1 => val1 [, op2 => val2 ... ] )

Returns a Cursor on the objects that are type-compatible with $remote.

A series of optional directives can be passed as key/value
pairs. Currently Tangram recognizes the following directives:

=over 4

=item * filter

=item * order

=item * desc

=item * retrieve

=back

For options C<filter>, C<order> and C<desc>, see C<select> above.

Option C<retrieve> is an array of Expr, to be retrieved in addition to
the object itself.

=head2 erase( @objs )

Removes objects from persistent storage. The objects remain present in transient storage.

=head2 tx_start

Starts a new Tangram transaction.

Tangram transactions can be nested.

Tangram maintains a transaction nesting count for each storage and commits the operations only
when that count reaches zero. This scheme makes it easy for a function to collaborate with its caller
in the management of the L<internal connection>.

Example:

   sub f
   {
      $storage->tx_start();
      $storage->update( $homer );
      $storage->tx_commit(); # or perhaps rollback()
   }

   sub g
   {
      $storage->tx_start();
      f();
      $storage->update( $marge );
      $storage->tx_commit(); # or perhaps rollback()
   }

   f(); # 1
   g(); # 2


In (1), f() commits the changes to $homer directly to the database.

In (2), f() transparently reuses the transaction opened by g().\
Changes to both $homer and $marge are commited to the database when g() calls tx_commit().

=head2 tx_commit

Commits the current Tangram transaction for this storage.
If the transaction being commited is the outermost transaction for this storage, the DBI
transaction is also commited.

=head2 tx_rollback

Rolls back the current Tangram transaction for this storage.
If the transaction being rolled back is the outermost transaction for this storage, the DBI
transaction is also rolled back.

=head2 tx_do( CODEREF, @args )

Executes CODEREF under the protection of a Tangram transaction and
pass it @args in the argument list.

Rolls back the transaction if CODEREF dies; in which case the
exception is re-thrown.

Returns the results of CODEREF, either as a scalar or as a list
depending on the context in which tx_do was called.

Example:

   $storage->tx_do(
      sub
      {
         $storage->update( $homer );
         # do things, die perhaps
         $storage->update( $marge );
      } );

Both $homer and $marge will be updated, or none will, depending on
whether the anonymous subroutine passed to tx_do() dies.

=head2 unload( @objs )

Drops references to persistent objects present in memory. @objs may
contain both objects and object ids. If @objs is empty, unloads all
the objects loaded by this storage.

Storage keeps track of all the persistent objects that are present in
memory, in order to make sure that loading the same object twice
results in a single copy of the object.

As a consequence, these objects will not be reclaimed by Perl's
automatic memory management mechanism until either disconnect() or
unload() is called.

reset() should be called only when no other references exist to
persistent objects, otherwise the same object (in the database) may
end up having two copies in transient storage.

=head2 disconnect

Disconnects from the database. Drops references to persistent
objects present in memory (see L<unload>).

=head1 INTERNAL CONNECTION

Except in the implementation of cursor(), Tangram uses a single DBI connection in its operations.
That connection is called the 'internal' connection. Since, in general, database managers
do not allow multiple result sets on the same connection, the internal connection can be used
only to carray a single task at a time.

L<Tangram::Cursor>s returned by cursor() do not suffer from this limitation
because they use a separate DBI connection.
