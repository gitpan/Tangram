=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Remote object is a client-side representation of an object that resides in a database.
It has the same fields as a normal object of the same class - as declared in the Schema
associated to the database the Remote was obtained from.
The values of the fields are not normal Perl values, but L<Tangram::Expr>s that will be evaluated
on the database server side.

Remote objects are somewhat similar to SQL table aliases.
