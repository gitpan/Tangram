=head1 NAME

Tangram::Core - import core Tangram modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Tangram::Core;

   # use additional types, e.g.:
   use Tangram::Type::Array::FromMany;
   use Tangram::Type::Set::FromOne;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module imports only the parts of Tangram that are thought to be
essential to any app. This includes: Schema, Storage, Cursor, Expr,
Scalar and Ref. None of the modules that map collections (Array, Hash,
Set and their intrusive variants) are imported. Neither is Deploy.

Tangram::Core allows you to reduce script startup time (and executable
size when perlcc can handle Tangram) by importing only what you
really need. It also makes it possible to add new mappings to Tangram
without penalizing apps that don't need them.
