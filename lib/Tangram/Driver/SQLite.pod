Tangram::Driver::SQLite - Orthogonal Object Persistence in SQLite databases

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Tangram;
   use Tangram::Driver::SQLite;

   $schema = Tangram::Driver::SQLite->schema( $hashref );

   Tangram::Driver::SQLite->deploy($schema, $dbh);

   $storage = Tangram::Driver::SQLite->connect( $schema,
      $data_source, $username, $password );

   $storage->disconnect();

   Tangram::Driver::SQLite->retreat($schema, $dbh);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the entry point in the SQLite-specific object-relational
persistence backend.

=head1 ERRATA

For reasons similar to the L<Tangram::Driver::Pg> module, this
back-end automatically encodes L<Tangram::Type::Dump::Storable>
objects via L<MIME::Base64> to avoid truncation of values on NUL
bytes.

Also, note that despite what is mentioned on the front page of
L<www.sqlite.org>, SQLite is not actually an ACID database; any writer
to the database has to wait for all other writers to finish before
they can begin their transaction.

So make sure you start and complete your transactions as quickly as
possible with this back-end.
