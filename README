Tangram is an object-relational mapper. It makes objects persist in
relational databases, and provides powerful facilities for retrieving
and filtering them. Tangram fully supports object-oriented programming,
including polymorphism, multiple inheritance and collections.
It does so in an orthogonal fashion, that is, it doesn't require
your classes to implement support functions nor inherit from a utility class.

Tangram builds upon DBI, so you'll need to install DBI and at least
one DBD driver if that is not done already. You will also need
Set::Object. These modules are available from CPAN.

If you intend to run the regression tests (recommended), you will
also need to prepare an empty database before starting the installation
procedure.

For more information, see the included POD files.
