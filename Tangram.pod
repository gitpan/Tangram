=head1 NAME

Tangram - Orthogonal Object Persistence in Relational Databases

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tangram is an object-relational mapper. It makes objects persist in
relational databases, and provides powerful facilities for retrieving
and filtering them.  Tangram fully supports object-oriented
programming, including polymorphism, multiple inheritance and
collections.  It does so in an orthogonal fashion, that is, it doesn't
require your classes to implement support functions nor inherit from a
utility class.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

Tangram is known to run in the following environments, however,
Tangram uses standard SQL and should be usable with any SQL-83
compliant database.

Note that some functions (e.g. transactions and subselects) may not be
available in some environments. This is reported during the test suite.
